The Project is on the analysis of the greenhouse gases, CO2 emissions, population, and the GDP of the countries and 
how each country what the relationship between these factors is, and how has the relationship changed over time
A brief introduction to the project: The relationship between consumption CO2(CO2 produced on the import of 
products, goods from other countries for your self-use), Production CO2(CO2 generated as a result of industrial 
growth, and anything within a country for its sustenance) population, GDP, income bracket of the countries may seem 
straight forward. Are underdeveloped and developing countries facing more challenges to improving economically 
because of this? The scope of the project is from 1980-2018.

The conclusions that we arrived at are better explained in the visualizations and the PowerPoint presentation.

What we are trying to do is to analyze the relationship between all of the different variables that are not really directly 
visible to us. The questions we are trying to answer are the following.
a. How does the GDP per capita affect the emission and consumption of CO2? Relationship between population 
vs CO2 emissions from a particular region.
b. Is there pressure on developing countries to reduce their CO2 emissions from developed countries?
c. Predicted impacts on emissions by implementing policies, measures, pledges, and targets set up for net-zero
emissions.
d. How are the measures, and policies implemented across countries?
e. What should be done to optimize the net CO2 emissions for different countries?
